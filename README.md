# Executive Summary
## Company Overview: DDSAnalytics

DDSAnalytics is a data-driven consulting firm specializing in predictive analytics and modeling solutions. With a strong focus on leveraging statistical methodologies and machine learning techniques, DDSAnalytics empowers organizations to make informed decisions based on data insights.

## Project Scope: Attrition Prediction for Frito Lay

Recently, DDSAnalytics has been engaged by Frito Lay to develop a predictive model aimed at understanding employee attrition within the company. Recognizing the critical impact of workforce stability on operational efficiency and cost management, Frito Lay seeks to identify potential attrition risks and implement strategic interventions.

## Model Development

To achieve this objective, DDSAnalytics will create and evaluate two distinct predictive models: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Naive Bayes. Each model will be trained on historical employee data to discern patterns and factors associated with attrition.

k-NN Model: This model will leverage distance-based metrics to classify employee attrition likelihood based on similarities with historical data points.

Naive Bayes Model: Utilizing probabilistic principles, this model will estimate the probability of an employee leaving based on their characteristics and behaviors.

Both models will undergo rigorous evaluation to determine which one provides superior accuracy and reliability in predicting attrition.

## Blind Data Application

Upon identifying the most effective model, DDSAnalytics will apply the selected model to a blind dataset provided by Frito Lay. This analysis will serve to validate the modelâ€™s performance and ensure its applicability to real-world scenarios within the organization.

## Deliverables

All findings, methodologies, and results will be documented comprehensively. DDSAnalytics will provide presentation materials and the accompanying code in both R Markdown and PowerPoint formats. These resources will facilitate knowledge transfer, enabling Frito Lay's teams to understand the analytical processes and insights generated through this project.

# Conclusion

Through this collaboration, DDSAnalytics aims to equip Frito Lay with robust predictive capabilities that will enhance their understanding of employee attrition. By leveraging advanced modeling techniques, the company will be better positioned to implement proactive measures, ultimately fostering a more stable and engaged workforce.
